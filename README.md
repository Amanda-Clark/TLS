# CS 255 project
I decided to tackle a CS 255 project from Stanford's Introduction to Cryptography class I found online.

I took some liberties, like completely ignoring the pinned cert requirement, since after I found out what 
I needed to do, I was honestly too lazy to implement it. I have a day job and do enjoy doing things other than programming!
As long as I understand the concept, I'm a okay with that.

It's a nice way to learn some basic crypto concepts and work on improving my Python.
